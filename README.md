# ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the research situation of the breast cancer detection with computer science challenges. Based on the computer science data base platforms: Kaggle and GitHub, the research of breast cancer detection can be divided into two different types of data and there exists various methods and algorithms aiming at each types of data. I propose two research questions and then answer them with data analysis. The first question is answered that deep learning algorithms are more powerful for images type datasets. The section question is showed that SVM for machine learning and CNNs for deep learning both have good performance and the other algorithms analysis and details will be discussed in the finding section.
